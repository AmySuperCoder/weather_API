This is the screen you will see open the site in the browser. To see the weather in a given city, write the city's name in the text box under "Search for a city:", and then click Search. You will see the current conditions for that city on the right with the 5 day forecast below it.

If you want to delete a previously-viewed city from your history list, click the trash can next to the city name.
